The gist of this lecture was to login to our server and get the idea of ssh to a remote machine.
First connect to the campus network, and then:

ssh username@nsm-stats.csus.edu

   10  ls
   11  whoami
   12  exit
   13  pwd
   14  ls
   15  pwd
   16  # Pick a password
   17  # passphrase
   18  # change our passwords
   19  passwd 
   20  pwd
   21  ls
   22  mkdir stat129
   23  ls
   24  exit
